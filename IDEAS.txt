Model Creation
***************
- For the Ngrams:
	- We should keep the highest (or 2-3 highest) Strings in which a word is repeated. For now delete all the ones that have one hit.

- Combine sources:
	Df_agg <- aggregate(. ~  Count, data = DF, sum)

- When there is no hit, it migth be interesting to use similarity of words?

- Create list of movies, books
